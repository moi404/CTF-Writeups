# 🔵 Basic Pentesting – TryHackMe

## 📌 Overview

This room focuses on fundamental penetration testing techniques including enumeration, service discovery, brute-forcing, and privilege escalation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform network enumeration
- Identify exposed services
- Gain initial access
- Escalate privileges

---

## 🔍 Step 1 – Enumeration

### 🔎 Nmap Scan

- Identified open ports
- Discovered running services
- Detected potential attack vectors

Key Findings:
- SSH service exposed
- Web server running
- SMB service available

---

## 🌐 Step 2 – Web Enumeration

- Directory brute-forcing
- Identified hidden directories
- Discovered potential credentials

---

## ⚔️ Step 3 – Gaining Access

- Brute-force attack on SSH
- Successfully obtained user credentials
- Initial shell access established

---

## 🔐 Step 4 – Privilege Escalation

- Enumerated system permissions
- Identified misconfigurations
- Escalated privileges to root

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Nmap
- Gobuster
- Hydra
- SSH
- LinPEAS

---

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- Enumeration is critical
- Weak passwords remain a major vulnerability
- Misconfigured permissions can lead to privilege escalation

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

Thorough enumeration leads to successful exploitation.
