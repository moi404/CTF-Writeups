## 🧠 Methodology

Each room follows a structured approach:

1. 🔍 Enumeration  
   - Nmap scanning  
   - Service detection  
   - Directory brute-forcing  

2. ⚔️ Exploitation  
   - Vulnerability identification  
   - Exploit selection  
   - Manual testing  

3. 🔐 Privilege Escalation  
   - Linux enumeration (LinPEAS)  
   - Windows enumeration (WinPEAS)  

4. 📚 Lessons Learned  
   - Key vulnerabilities  
   - Security misconfigurations  
   - Defensive recommendations
